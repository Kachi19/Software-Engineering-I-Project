Software Engineering I Project

Online clothing store implemented by : Killian Lynch, Onyenkachi Ngwaba, Morojuoluwa Oke, Patrice Minimah, Ifeanyi Anyaeto
 

1)	The goal for our project was for us to be able to create a working online thrift store where the user would be able to buy, sell, donate, return, and trade/exchange the specified clothing items in the store. 
We want to make it a simple and easy online experience for our users. 
The goal is to be able to keep track of how much money that the user spends while shopping or earns while selling. We have 5 people in our group, so we wanted to make sure we had at least 5 use cases. 
By the end of the project we ended up passing our goal. 

2)	Our potential users are anyone who is looking for an easy online experience to buy, sell, trade, or exchange. 
People looking for an easy to use online thrift store. 
 
3)	In our project we have a total of 7 use cases described below. 

Starting in chronological order of the project. 

When the user decides to enter the store and he or she is prompted to select the number corresponding to the action they wish to take. 

The first Use Case we have is the buying of the clothes. During this buy of an item the users are prompted to enter either buy a T-shirt for $8, 
Shoes for $85, Hats for the price $5, Belts for $12, Shorts for $15, and pants for $25. 
Based off type and quantity the account balance will be updated accordingly.	

The next Use Case is selling items. When a user wishes to sell an item to the store, he/she follows the prompted instructions on the screen. 
They give a description of the item that is being sold, and the amount that said item is worth. This action also updates the users credited amount. 

The next Use Case on the online store is the donations aspect. 
This is a simpler interface where the user is asked what item they would like to donate to the store. 
The user then inputs what he or she wishes to donate to our store, and then they are greeted by a thank you printed on the screen as the item has been successfully donated.

The next Use Case of the program is returns. 
This is when a user has bought a specified item from the store but have a reason they need to return it. 
The returns use case works directly with the buyer and seller to refund the item and cost for that item.

The next Use Case is the trading interface. 
When the user decides he has an item that he would like to trade to the store, he/she selects the amount that the item costs and then is prompted to pick what item they are trading for. 
If the user is trading a cheaper item for a more expensive item, the remaining cost is taken out of the users account to cover the difference in price. 
If the cost of the item they are trading exceeds the cost of the item they wish to trade for then the account will be reimbursed the difference accordingly.

The next Use Case interface is the check balance aspect. 
This is used throughout the process of the store. 
When the user decides that they would like to check the balance they can do so at any time. 
The checking balance use case is constantly being updated as the user shops. 
From buying, selling and trading the account will always be updated.

The last use case is the project is the exiting of the online thrift store. 
After the user has decided they are done with their shopping they can simply follow the instructions in order to end their experience and receive a nice message thanking them for visiting the store.
